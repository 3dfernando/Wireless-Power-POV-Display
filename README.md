# Wireless-Power-POV-Display
This project was designed as a hobby acivity by a Mechanical Engineer. Therefore, it probably has a lot of problems from the Electrical Engineering point of view. If you think you can improve this project, please branch this Git and comment!

The project consists of a POV (Persistence of Vision) display that, unlike most of the POV displays found in the internet, is not powered by a battery but by the mains power. The regular battery-powered design is a simple solution to the problem of supplying the power needed to light up the LEDs and power the processor [Which are spinning], by making the battery also spin. 

Although the solution is effective, it's a hassle to be applied for a decorative clock, for example, as one needs to stop and access the device from time to time to recharge the battery.

The next easiest way of avoiding this problem is through a brushed connection. This is also possible, although it might be a little bit too noisy for a decorative device. So I thought a wireless power transfer system would be a perfect solution! So why not try it out and in the middle of the path learn more about wireless power transfer?
