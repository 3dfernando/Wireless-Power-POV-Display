# Wireless-Power-POV-Display
This project was designed as a hobby acivity by a Mechanical Engineer. Therefore, it probably has a lot of problems from the Electrical Engineering point of view. If you think you can improve this project, please branch this Git and comment!

The project consists of a POV (Persistence of Vision) display that, unlike most of the POV displays found in the internet, is not powered by a battery but by the mains power. The regular battery-powered design is a simple solution to the problem of supplying the power needed to light up the LEDs and power the processor [Which are spinning], by making the battery also spin. 

Although the solution is effective, it's a hassle to be applied for a decorative item, for example, as one needs to stop and access the device from time to time to recharge the battery. Normally decorative objects have a no-maintenance requirement (which in some cases might be extremely difficult to achieve!).

The next easiest way of avoiding this problem is through a brushed connection. This is also possible, although it might be a little bit too noisy for a decorative device - and still would be hard for a DIY setup to require no maintenance after some hours of operation. So I thought a wireless power transfer system would be a perfect solution! So why not try it out and in the middle of the path learn more about wireless power transfer?
